# online-financial-aid

This was created at Georgia State University's first hackathon, CEO Hacks 2015. The theme of the hackathon was "Hack the School," where participants create hacks that improve the college life. This is a website that will allow students to log in and wait in a virtual queue to chat with a financial aid counselor. Their place in line is shown on the web page, and when their turn comes, they can chat with an available financial aid counselor.
